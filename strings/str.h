 *
 * NOTES:
 * - Calls str_reserve() for memory allocation, see notes for str_reserve()
 * - The contents of src are copied into the newly-created string.
 * - If src is a pointer to a location within a string, then only the
 *     remaining characters from src to the end of the string are copied.
